# Hurray, it worked!

You can now send transactional mails using Mailcoach.

To learn all the options, read [the docs on sending transactional emails in Laravel](https://mailcoach.app/docs/cloud/using-mailcoach/transactional-mails/using-laravel).

Mailcoach can do much more besides sending transactional emails. It is a complete email marketing platform that covers all your email needs for a fraction of the cost. Mailcoach can send email campaigns to lists of any size. We also offer best-in-class email automation, so you can easily create drip campaigns and more.

Mailcoach is the most affordable email solution. Most of our competitors price by the size of your email list; we price by the number of mails sent.
